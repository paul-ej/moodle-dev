# Tooling

## Overview
Here's a list of the tools that I use, connected to my GitHub, to ensure I'm not posting any nasties online, and to streamline my workflow!

## IDE

### Visual Studio Code
Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/
Has everything you want from a code editor. Blazing fast, extensible further than I could feasibly throw a golf ball, and very well supported, with frequent update cycles, powerful customisation and integrations that you'll want to tell your family about over sunday lunch. Throw in intellisense, built-in Git commands, and you've got yourself a real doosy.


## Secret Management

### 1Password

I've been a 1Password customer for 11 years, and it's easy to see why. Cross-platform passwords available at your fingertips, ability to store secrets and access them programatically, and a fun presence on the Apple Watch, an absolute belter.


## CI/CD

### Azure DevOps

Powerful DevOps services, featuring Repos, cloud-hosted pipelines with simple configuration and editing options, test planning, artifact storage, and a wealth of integrated marketplace apps.


## Security & Infrastructure

### Terraform Cloud

The Rolls Royce of provisioning infrastructure. Using Terraform Cloud, I connect to my GitHub for version control, and use Terraform Cloud to store vairables, and securely store remote state data. Much niftier in enterprise? Yes. A load off for working locally? Absolutely.

### Jit.IO

What can I say about Jit? The entire DevSecOps toolchain, stuffed into one absolute belter of a platform. Secret detection, SAST, DAST, code quality, security controls to enable compliance via policy, anything you can think of, it's here. Incredible VS Code extension too. Seriously, give this a try.
